# MaraudersMap

The central knowledge base of `GargoyleOffGrid` —
a living library of survival guides, off-grid schematics, resource links, and homestead playbooks. Think of it as the "map that reveals what’s hidden."

---

## Current Focus
Right now, this repo is focused on being a **knowledge hub**:
- Documentation & survival guides  
- Off-grid schematics (power, water, food, comms, shelter)  
- Resource indexes (books, manuals, trusted networks)  
- Inventory templates  

---

## Future Expansions (eventually…)
The Map is still unfolding. Over time, this repo will grow into:  
- **Mapping / Monitoring Tool** → visualize devices, nodes, and services on your off-grid network (Raspberry Pis, solar panels, radios).  
- **Resource Tracker** → water, food, power, tools — mapped in Markdown/JSON for quick reference.  
- **Access / Secrets Management** → credentials, configs, and hidden access points managed safely.  
- **Digital Visualization** → “see what’s alive on your hidden grid.”  

---

## Structure
- docs/         → survival guides & playbooks
- schematics/   → wiring diagrams, blueprints
- resources/    → indexes & reference materials
- inventory/    → supply logs & templates
- scripts/      → helper tools & automation
- map_index.md  → the ‘map’ linking everything


##  License
MIT — knowledge should be free to those who need it.
